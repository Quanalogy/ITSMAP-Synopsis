\chapter{Vision for the application}
At its core, the application wishes to empower the user with information about gas prices, in order to allow for the user to save money by going the extra mile.

The target demographic of the application is owners and users of gas powered vehicles, where they themselves are responsible for purchasing gas, without any prior affiliation with a specific brand of gas station. The application will enable the user to save money, by making an informed decision about where to purchase gas next time.  The application uses crowd-sourced data, extracted from purchase data, which the user stores in a ledger.

There are two intended modes of operation for the application:	\emph{Stationary/planning} and \emph{En route}

In the first case, the application shows nearby gas stations, and can help the user with directions to the selected station if so desired. In the second case, the user needs to top-up the tank while going from A to B. The application will then show possible stations which are close to the route, and can show altered navigation guides from A to B, with a stop at the desired station.

%In order to function optimally, the application allows for users to send data about the current prices at the gas station to a central server. As such, the application data is crowd-sourced.

%The application will also be able to present previously entered ledger data and statistics of these.
