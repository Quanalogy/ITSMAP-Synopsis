\chapter{Vision for the application}
The application is a crowd sourced, Pricerunner\texttrademark\ like app for finding the cheapest gas price. At its core, the application wishes to empower the user with information about gas prices, in order to allow for the user to save money by going the extra mile. It will include a ledger, for storing gas purchases, which will be shared with other users (crowd-sourced).

There are two intended modes of operation for the application: \emph{Stationary/planning} and \emph{En route}. In the first case, the application shows nearby gas stations, and can help the user with directions to the selected station. In the second case, the user needs to fill the tank while going from A to B. The application will then show possible stations which are close to the route, and can show altered navigation guides from A to B, with a stop at the desired station.
