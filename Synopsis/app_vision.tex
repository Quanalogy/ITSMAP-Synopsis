\chapter{Vision for the application}
The application is a crowd sourced, Pricerunner\texttrademark\ like app for finding the cheapest gas price. At its core, the application wishes to empower the user with information about gas prices, in order to allow for the user to save money by going the extra mile. It will include a ledger, for storing gas purchases. The prices will be shared with other users (crowd-sourced).
